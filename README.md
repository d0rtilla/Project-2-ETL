# Project 2: ETL - GDP and Coffee Consumption
## Overview: For project 2, we were tasked with extracting, transforming, and loading datasets into a PostgreSQL database.
## Members: Jae Neuharth, Maryam Osman, Ilia Phiranishvili
## Database chosen: PostgreSQL
## Instructions:
Create a database named `coffeegdp_db`, load the `schema.sql` file into query tool and create the included `concat_consumption` and `trimmed_gdp` tables. In the terminal, enter the `PythonData38` venv and start `jupyter notebook`. Open `Coffee-Cleanup.ipynb` and enter your postgres `username`, `password`, and proper `port` for your machine into the database connection section. After entering required data, run all outputs; the database tables will now be populated. Double check that both of the database tables are populated in pgAdmin.
